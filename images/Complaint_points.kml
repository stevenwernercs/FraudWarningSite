Shawn *******, the owner, is continuing to defraud others, now with a new business name. He takes 50% downpayment on work that he doesn't complete. We were sold on the promise that he would start and complete our fencing project within 3 weeks of receiving our downpayment. We gave his salesman, Zantana *****, a $6k downpayment, and the fence was never built and it's been over 3.5 months! He has operated under several aliases "CCI Fencing", "Condor Fencing", " "Straight Cut Fencing" and now "Edge Fencing". Last month, we sent him a notarized, certified mail with USPS alerting him that he officially needs to refund us. We gave him 10 business days. He did not refund us. We are now going to file a suit in small claims court against him. Also, if the BBB blurs out his last name, look up "Consumers File Police Report Against Local Contractor" by NBC5 Dallas. It's sickening!!\nDesired Outcome\nRefund]]></description>

Call asap. Co promised to stain fence at completion of project. Co needs to fix motor and closure issues on electric gate. We have had issues with the fence since the installation that took from 10/28/20 to the end of 12/04/20 to complete. The remote to the motor fails, the chain is too lose to work with the remote. The fence gets stuck and will not close. We have to dismantle the electric motor and release the lock on the motor manually to close and open the heavy fence by hand (which is very heavy - after having rotator cuff shoulder surgery in February, 2021). The fence wobbles when the remote opens it. It does not seem stable and raises security concerns. After paying Straight Cut 1/2 of the price to start the project, their workers began the project by removing the old fence and leaving our backyard opened and exposed and then worked left our project to finish other projects they were working on for several weeks. We called numerous times requesting that the project manager, Zantana T**** (**************) have his workers to come back and finish the job. The contractor Shawn would state a date/time to continue the work and then not show up. I took off work numerous times to be available when work was scheduled, but the contractor/workers for Straight Fence did not show up and many times did not even return the call. When the project was finally completed late, we had to almost deny the final 1/2 payment to ensure the project was completed correctly and cleaning up was done after the project, i.e., nails picked up, trash removed, sweeping of grounds, and dirt and debris removed from the concrete driveway. These are things the workers should have cleared away at the end of the project automatically. The Straight Cut manager and owner Shawn (who never provided his last name, in spite of our request), stated that since Straight Cut was delayed in completing the project he would include a free staining of the inside/outside of the fence. As of 03/30/2021 and to our dismay, despite over twenty telephone calls to Shawn and his project manager, we have been told that the wood on the fence was (1) too new to stain; (2) weather conditions made it too wet to stain the fence. We have called so many times and now they no longer accept Vince V*********'s calls and have not even returned his calls or text messages. Straight Cut gave us a ten-year written warranty on the fence. We doubt they will be in existence as a company to honor this warranty. This is very important since we are already experiencing problems with the fence's motor & chain and the remote not working properly. We are very dissatisfied with the customer service of this company. At this point, we would like to know what needs to be done to hold this contractor responsible for the poor workmanship and lazy attitude when it comes to needed repairs, not staining the fence as agreed, or just poor customer service and refusal to return our calls.\nDesired Outcome\n\nStraight Cut Fencing needs to: 1. Return my calls and set up appointments to check the Gate; 2. Brackets bend on gate are inferior for chain and need to be replaced; 3. Chain is loose; 4. Motor needs adjusting; 5. Door needs to be made sturdy; 6. Staining of Inside and Outside of Fence as promised; 7. Guarantee of Warranty for Ten Years. To fix issues. This is just month #4 and they will not return numerous calls and text messages I have left. How can they provide a ten year warranty if they cannot even return calls after just a few months.]]></description>

After this mistake they did not make us aware and well pump ran all night until we realized. Explained to them we know mistakes are made but please tell us. Fixed water line myself. A few days later they came back and busted our neighbors water line and just poured sacrete and kept going. 6 weeks  later our neighbor showed up with a $600 water bill and another on the way. Again, they did not notify us of the mistake or attempt to fix it. When I called them to tell them what was going on, they said they would get back to me but never did. I repaired the water line myself, and am now waiting on my neighbors second excessive water bill to resolve the matter. I do not recommend this company!!]]></description>

No fence 6 weeks later. On November 11,2020 my husband paid Straight Cut Fencing A deposit $10,000 for the build of a new fence in our one acre in Waxahachie. I assumed the build would start in a few days. During the 1st week of December we begin reaching out to them to see what the hold was in our fence and was told numerous times the next, the next day. By the 2nd week if December, 2 guys showed up and walked around our home and left. They returned a few day's later with some form of a hole digger. I approached them and was informed that they were not Straight Cut Fence but ***** ************* I became immediately upset and concerned given their was not the company we paid or contracted for our fence services. Per the contract Straight Cur Fencing were AUTHORIZED to do the work. These two gentlemen dug holes and smoked cigarettes on our property for 2 weeks. No pole installation, no cement, no fence installation. After the 3rd week if them showing up on my property mid day I told my husband to tell them to get off our property and contact the company to return our deposit. Needless to say, and hour later the owner of straight cut fence showed up in my property with a few poles and him and one of the other gentleman started throwing them in the holes. Keep in mind this is 3 hours after they have been sitting on my property and after I asked them leave and return our money. The owner of Staight Cut Fence then came to my door and asked me to just give him a few more days and he would get a crew together and he could get our fence done the week of Christmas. I told him no and what day was he planning to return or $10,000 deposit. This was 12/21/2020. I asked him if he was in business for 20 years why would he not have his own crew and staff the worked for him? He just stood there. He then proceeded to tell me he has purchased poles and I informed him that we gave him $10,000 so we expected to have an entire fence as contracted. Not just a random company on our property destroying it and leaving remnants of cigarettes. He informed me he would be bringing a check the following day. He has since ignored our calls and texts and has not returned our deposit. I have since visited the office address listed online and on BBB and it's actually not an amazing five of Straight Cut Fence. It's actually a ***** real estate office the are using the address as part of their fraud. The gentleman that came to our home is Tanner XXX-XXX-XXXX. The owner is Shawn ******* XXX-XXX-XXXX. The Other gentleman who was on our property for over 2 weeks walking, smoking cigarettes and digging holes is Anthony ***** XXX-XXX-XXXX. We paid this company a $10,000 deposit and after 6 weeks we have holes in the yard of our brand new home and an acre of cigarette butts. Other companies have built fences in less than a week in our neighborhood for homes who closed weeks after us. It should of taken less than a day for the holes to be dug in 1 acre of land. I sincerely need your assistance in ensuring this does not happen to another family. We are in a pandemic and to be basically robbed of $10,000 is unacceptable. I'm taking every legal avenue to get of money return.\nDesired Outcome\n\nI want our deposit returned as agreed upon by company. I want the BBB to ensure this company is held accountable for utilizing a false address in there business and this does not happen to another unsuspecting family. We have surveillance camera on all sides and back of our property]]></description>

This guy Shawn is no stranger to ripping people off. It took me 1 1/2 years to get my fence installed (prior to COVID). My neighbor has tried to get his installed for over 2 years and Shawn won't refund his money. He advertises a 10 year warranty but will not take or return calls about his shotty work. He promises FREE stain but never follows through. He short cuts hardware leaving an unstable fence. This guy is a thief and has had many victims. He especially preys on the elderly. He has been featured on NBC5 investigates at least 3 times that I know of. I should have known after giving my 50% deposit that a call from a check cashing place meant trouble. Buyer do your research. Terrible reviews are everywhere including the BBB which he advertised being a part of but is NOT. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY! SHAWN NEEDS TO BE SHUT DOWN!]]></description>

It has crumbled and disintegrated. Condor Fence replaced 3/4 of my back yard fence in April 2015. My contact person was John. I paid $3461 (by check, in 3 installments) for roughly 75 linear feet of cedar fence, with metal poles. The workmen told me the poles were 9 feet long, going 3 feet into the ground for more stability. This fence is above a retaining wall, so stability was especially important to me. They told me, "These poles are not going to move." A couple years after they did the work, my fence was already leaning. My yard man pointed out that the concrete at the base of the poles had crumbled. His diagnosis is that they did not mix the concrete, but just dumped it in the hole with water. Now there is basically no support for the fence poles.\nDesired Outcome\n\nI would like them to refund the amount I paid for the fence, or at least some portiong of it. I will need to pay someone else to do the work they did not do.]]></description>

I want my money back due to no services rendered to date. On 7/2/19 I signed a contract for a new fence. Paid $700 deposit, half of price. No paper copy given of contract, only a picture sent to my cell phone. Was told it would be completed in 2 weeks. Was told after a week there would be flags in the yard and they would be a week out for the fence. After over a week, no flags, contacted company and was told it would now be 2-3 weeks before completion. On 7/23/19 I contacted them again and was asked for the picture of the contract to be sent to them because he had a new phone. No communication after that. I contacted them on 8/16/19 (6.5 weeks out) and asked when they would do the fence. No reply. Contacted again on 8/19, 8/21, 9/6, 9/7, 9/16, 9/17, 9/18, 9/19, finally on 9/19 they said they would be at my house the beginning of the next week to do it. On 9/24/19 texted them again, no reply. On 9/25 texted again and was told he would call me (the owner, Shawn *******) and set posts on 9/26. On 9/26 nothing was done, he claimed he came by and got material list. On 9/27 nothing done and no communication. On 9/30 still nothing, so I asked for my money to be returned for non-service. On 10/1, 10/3, 10/4, 10/5, 10/6, 10/7, 10/8, 10/9, and 10/10 I have initiated contact asking for my money back. I have reported him to the FTC and let him know. I am contacting an attorney today to find out about a demand letter to get my money back. This guy doesn't call when he says he will, he gives every excuse he can to not communicate. He will send a text every now and then saying he'll call me, but he never calls. I have to initiate contact every time, he never has. To date I have never spoken with the owner, only had a few texts from him. The contract was signed with an employee. They have never been back to my house in almost 4 months since the initial contact. No services have been rendered, nothing has been purchased for materials, nothing has been done. They cashed my $700 deposit check the very next day on 7/3/19. I want my money back. I have been put in a bind now because I have no fence, my current fence is falling apart, and I have had my money stolen by this company. I cannot get another contractor to do the work without getting this guy to give me my money back. Worst customer service, very unprofessional, never answers his phone, never communicates about services, and now committing fraud.\nDesired Outcome\n\nAll I want at this point is my money back. The owner sent one text in reply to my many, on 10/5/19 stating that I would get my money back, but not when. I have texted him daily asking him to return my money, to mail my money, to bring it to me, any way I can to try to get it back. At this point he knows he's in the wrong and hasn't provided any services. He knows he needs to return my money, but he just keeps making excuses so he doesn't have to call me. I have only gotten a handful of replies from him to my texts, usually stating that he's driving, he's on a big job, he'll call me later, but I never hear from him again. Please help me get my money back.]]></description>

Same owner at same home address. *0% of $6,*00 paid. Job contracted for completion 7-26-19. Not done. Up front I failed to get the full names of the owners of this small company. I failed to check that data since I did not have it and that was a fatal mistake. Everything was going well until I noticed they were not digging the post holes the 2.* to 3 feet deep as agreed to in contract. I complained, they said soil was too rocky. I said I would pay an extra $20 to get the final 6 inches to be certain we had a solid fence. They indirectly agreed and then began not answering my phone and promising "next day we **** be there" constantly until it became ridiculous. I called using other phones and ***** would answer giving another excuse, transmission problems etc... (It was the same behavior I found in reading the 27 BBB complaints today against ******.) Today I gave up when he or his staff did not show up as they had agreed to for about the 10th time. I checked out his cell number using an online service and found his correct last name, *******, as well as the history of a 2017 bankruptcy, a 2010 DWI, and that he had lived at the same ********** address for over 20 years. Using his correct name I was able to find multiple complaints, one covered in a *********** paper and another covered by Channel *, but all under the ****** name. I had checked the CCI Fence name before signing the contract and had found nothing. This explained that. I also found positive things like ***** ******* donating $7,000 in labor and fencing work to a local community project. It is sad that this complaint in necessary. The reality of such a long record leaves no alternative. I must get my money back as the quality of the work apparently cannot be trusted, like the attempt to sink the posts in my fence at least 6 inches less deep than was contracted for. I have attached a copy of the contract. The URL for CCIFence.com was established in September 2018 and must be renewed this September. Due to this I am certain there are many other victims since almost a year ago under the CCI Fence name.\nDesired Outcome\n\nI want the full down payment back due to the lack of completion and the massive loss of time due to their constant delays. This has cost me money!]]></description>

Will not come off with carwash. Need special treatment to get it off My neighbor had a fence put up by Condor Fencing in January 2019. When he stained the fence he sprayed the stain and it got on two of my cars totally covering both cars with stain. This was in January. I contacted Shawn ******* immediately and was told to take it to carwash. The stain did not come off at carwash and was told by carwash owner it would take a special procedure to remove the stain. I contacted owner of Condor Fencing and he said he would take care of it. Here it is the middle of March 2019, and every time I contact him he gives me some excuse of why he hasn't taken care of this. I am the one doing the contacting. He very seldom responds back. One excuse after another. One of my cars is a lease car and I'm very concerned that this is going to be an issue. Shawn ******* is not a honest man and is basically giving me the runaround. This is Shawn ******* owner of Condor Fencing problem not mine.\nDesired Outcome\n\nCondor Fencing needs to pay me the $400 to take my cars to a reputable place and have the stain removed off of the finish of my car. If this is not correctly it could ruin the paint and finish on my cars]]></description>

There were countless ignored texts and phone calls and broken promises by Shawn to show up or even call back.  We were eventually forced to take the simplest to gate possible, just to finally get it done. This came with a broken promise to come back and add stylistic detail to the fence. Then there was the final broken promise to show up a few days later to stain the fence. No response to multiple attempts to contact him. I also later learned by a professional electrician that the wiring was incorrect and dangerous, with bare romex wire connecting the gate motor to the home electricity.  Don't risk your safety or waste your time, money, or energy on this one.  Run for the Hills!]]></description>

Absolutely horrible workmanship and Shawn is extremely unprofessional.  I originally gave them a down payment on March 9, 2016, had to constantly call/text them to come out and complete the work, which didn't happen until late June. The workmanship was insulting.  Rod iron was all scratched down to the steel, gates installed improperly, welding looked like it was completed by a 10 year old.  One of the gates fell off due to the bad welding, cut open my foot.  I was told by Shawn that he would replace everything.  2 months have gone by and they make excuse after excuse on why they can't come out.  Finally had Amex reverse the charges and now Shawn is threatening to place a mechanics lien on my house.  I will be taking him to small claims court if he does place a lien on the house.  This is about to get really expensive for him as I plan on recovering costs of material/labor, plus the cost of removing his rod iron, plus attorney's fees, and time wasted in court.\n\nThey have no business being in this business...]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[URL: https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/condor-fencing-mansfield?not_recommended_start=10<br>Company Name: Condor Fencing<br>Location: Lewisville, TX<br>Lat: 33.0463292<br>Lon: -96.9941903<br>Complaint: I had Condor Fencing install a wrought iron fence for me. It was supposed to be completed at the end of April 2015 and it is now September and the work has not been completed. Jon originally did the bid but the owner Shawn had to take over the job because of delays and manufacturing problems. Shawn will promise to be on the job a certain day and he generally doesn't make it. He tells you he will do something and he doesn't. I was told that the material was galvanized steel and I am already seeing rust. He never finished welding pet bars on a gate. He never installed the locks he said he would. The lift master gate they installed doesn't work right, one side closes very slow. He never ran the gate control wires under the driveway like he said he would. Bottom line is this company does shoddy work, they are not truthful, they do not finish the job and you will spend a lot of time begging them to do the job. So I pretty much blew $15,000 because I have to hire someone to fix the gate controller, paint the rusty places on the non-galvanized wrought iron, finish the welding that was never done, fix a gate that doesn't latch and have the locks installed on two other gates. I suggest you stay clear of this company because you will have problems and you will get ripped off! Do yourself a favor, hire another company!]]></description>
