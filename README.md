# FraudWarningSite

I was a victim of a fence contractor that took my $2750 deposit, and did not do the job. 2 Months later I wanted my money back, a month later I made this site after getting too many delays and excuses.

This site consolidates and displays the 64 total reviews online I was able to find on this 4 different company names in a 3 year span.


Simple single page site with using bootstrap 5 & Google Maps API
